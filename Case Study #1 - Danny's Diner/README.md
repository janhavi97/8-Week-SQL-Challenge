## **Introduction**
"Danny's Diner" specializes in sushi, curry, and ramen. The diner has captured basic operational data but needs assistance in leveraging this information to enhance customer service and operational efficiency.


## **Problem Statement**
The goal is to analyze customer behavior, including visit patterns and spending habits, to personalize their dining experience. Insights from the data will also determine the viability of expanding the loyalty program and provide Danny's team with accessible datasets for ongoing analysis.
